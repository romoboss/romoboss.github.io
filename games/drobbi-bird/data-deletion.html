  <h2>Leaderboard Data</h2>
  <p>You have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
      <p>Request removal of your leaderboard entry. Press the “Remove my data from the leaderboard” button or contact us directly via one of the contact options listed at <a href="/aboutme">romoboss.github.io/aboutme</a>.</p>
      <p>Request information about the data we hold related to your leaderboard submission.</p>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps on how to delete your data from the leaderboard</h4>
  <ul> 
    <h3>1. Inside of the game: </h3>
    <ul>
      <p>1. Launch "Drobbi Bird" using the device on which you submitted the data that you want to get removed from the servers.</p>
      <p>2. While in the main menu, click on the button that leads you to the leaderboards section (orange button with three black colored figures drawn on it).</p>
      <p>3. Click on the "Remove my data from the leaderboard" button.</p>
      <p>4. You're all done, all of the data submitted from the device you are currently using is deleted from the servers!</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. By contacting us outside the app (will take longer): </h3>
    <ul>
      <p>Contact us directly via one of the contact options listed at <a href="/aboutme">romoboss.github.io/aboutme</a>.</p>
      <p>Make sure to provide your username and proof that you own the account that submitted the score.</p>
      <p>I will try to respond as soon as possible. In case I do not reply to your message and the data still remains on the leaderboard, try to contact me using a different method.</p>
      <p>The proccess of manual removal may take up to 30 days.</p>
    </ul>
  </ul>
